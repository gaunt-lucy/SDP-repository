Question 2.
    a) One of the criteria for using a singleton is that lazy initialization would be desirable/necessary. In
    Scala, the 'Object' type natively implements the Singleton pattern lazily. E.g.:

    -------
    scala> object Example { println("Hello, World") }
    defined module Example

    scala> Example
    Hello, World
    res1: Example.type = Example$@37c8ccf4

    scala> Example
    res2: Example.type = Foo$@37c8ccf4
    -------
    Sometimes, it is appropriate to have a Singleton initialized immediately, for example if you are sure that
    the object will definitely be used immediately by the system. In this case it may be eagerly-initiated.
    In Scala, this can be achieved with a sealed case class:

    -------
    scala> sealed case class Singleton()
    class Singleton
