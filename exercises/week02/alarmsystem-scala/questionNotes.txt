AlarmSystem - Exercises

Question 3 - pollSensors method responsible for creating sensors and polling each one in turn and printing the results

Question 5 - pollSensors method now only responsible for polling sensors and printing results, no need to create sensors

Question 6 - the getBatteryPercent is redundant for the new use cases because neither sensor requires battery power

Question 7 - Principle violated is LSP; to resolve, remove redundant method from trait definition; add getBatteryPercentage method only to those sensors that need it.
